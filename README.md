# PigSlayer
## Pig Slayer - a very simple ScriptCraft mini-game

### How to Play

At the in-game prompt type '/js pigslayer(n)' to start playing. n is the
number of pigs needed to win the round.

Kill pigs to score points.

The first player to reach n pigs killed wins the round and the game starts
over.

Your score is displayed in a side-bar along the right edge of of the screen.

### Disclaimer and bugs

This is my very first experiment with ScriptCraft and Javascript. I assume
that the code looks ugly and disorganised in the eyes of 'real' programmer.

I created this game in order to learn.

The game needs to be started before players join, otherwise they will have to
re-join the server.

### Installation

This game is a ScriptCraft mod/plugin. You will need to have a Minecraft
server that runs the ScriptCraft mod.
